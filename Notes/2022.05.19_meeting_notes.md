* First step -- just model US Places and pairs.csv
* We can all try and generate our own features that we think are predictive
 * difference features
* look into graph models?

Brief summary of meeting with Shuvra:
* Need to figure out a regular meeting time (his form is in CT).
* About missing values: we can use available information to fill in some of them, like using (lati, long) to fill in zip code.
* About inbalance of the data:
 * Need to evaluate if it is really inbalanced (true:false is about 2:1)
 * To get balance data, we can either take subsampling or generate more pairs, based on how much data we have.
* He mentioned graph theory and graph neuron network, as some possibilities. But we may or may not consider that.
* The model to try first is logistic regression, since we are doing binary classification.
* One metric for comparing strings is Levenshtein distance.
